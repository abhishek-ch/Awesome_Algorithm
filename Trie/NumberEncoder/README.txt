Go to package com.numberencoding.main

Run The File MainFunction.java
It will show you following in the console-
Enter the path of dictionary file or 0 to exit: 
	(enter the path of dictionary file)

Enter the path of Input file to process or 0 to exit : 
	(enter the path of input file)
		
	
Sample:

Enter the path of dictionary file or 0 to exit: 
dictionary.txt
Enter the path of Input file to process or 0 to exit : 
input.txt

38- : so
10 : je
7-3593-50 : 7 da 9 da 0
-11/0 : 1 je
/93-8- : 9 so

The entire input file process is in loop , so once a dictionary is loaded you can keep adding different input files 
for testing unless user doesn't enter 0.
